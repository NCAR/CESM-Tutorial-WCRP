    "There are three ways in which you can start a simulation with CESM. Which way you use is determined\n",
    "by the xml variable `RUN_TYPE` in env run.xml. The three options are `startup`,`branch` and `hybrid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These have the following characteristics:\n",
    "- **startup**: all components are initialized using pre-defined baseline states that have been provided with CESM. So far we have only used this type of initialization\n",
    "- **branch**: all components are initialized using the complete set of restart files from a previous run.\n",
    "You specify the name of the previous run you want to start from and the date you want to start\n",
    "from with the xml variables `RUN_REFCASE` and `RUN_REFDATE`. The run continues on from the date\n",
    "that you restart from, so you canâ€™t change the start date with a branch run. The advantage of a\n",
    "branch run over the hybrid run is that it reproduces exactly (bit-for-bit) the solution that would be\n",
    "obtained if the original simulation that is used for the initialization were simply continued (provided no other changes have been made to the model).\n",
    "- **hybrid**: the simulation is initialized in a manner similar to a startup run, but instead of using the default initialization datasets, the initialization datasets are specified by the user, for example, they may be obtained from a previously performed simulation. Unlike for a branch run, the start date can be modified by the user and this method of initialization does not result in bit-for-bit similarity with the run that it is initialized from.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to change the output variables part way through a simulation, this can be done using a hybrid or a branch run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the command to change RUN_TYPE to hybrid is: \n",
    "```\n",
    "./xmlchange RUN_TYPE=hybrid\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you do this, you also need to change the reference case and the reference date. This can be done with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "./xmlchange RUN_REFCASE=... \n",
    "./xmlchange RUN_REFDATE=...\n",
    "```"
